Lernify: Project Design Review
1. Current Design (Assessed from GitHub Structure)
📌 Layout & Components
Basic Structure:

Header (Navbar) → Likely has a logo + navigation links.

Main Content → Static text/images (no dynamic data).

Footer → Simple links/copyright.

Missing Elements:

No interactive features (e.g., search, filters).

No responsive design (mobile-unfriendly).

🎨 Visual Style (Inferred)
Colors: Default browser styles (no custom theme).

Typography: Basic system fonts (no Google Fonts/CDN).

Spacing: Inconsistent padding/margins (no CSS framework).

📸 Current Design (Conceptual Diagram)
(Since no screenshots exist in the repo, here’s an approximation.)

Current LearnHub Design
Assumed layout: A plain navbar, placeholder content, and a simple footer.

Mobile-First Approach

Collapsible navbar (hamburger menu on small screens).

Grid-based content for tablets/phones.

Engaging Visuals
